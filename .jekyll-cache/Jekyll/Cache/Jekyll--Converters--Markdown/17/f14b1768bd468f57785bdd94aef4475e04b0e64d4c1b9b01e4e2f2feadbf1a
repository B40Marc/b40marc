I"Ô<p>Why not smile? Smiles are contagious, and multiply. There are at least 15 types of smiles. Babies are innate smilers, and a smile is  universally one of each humans first acts.</p>

<p>Smiles can be faked, even insincere. And then thereâ€™s the Duchenne smile, look it up. The real deal, itâ€™s nearly unfakable and a genuine expression of inner emotion. Duchenneâ€™s involve lips, cheeks and eye muscles which have no voluntary motor response.</p>

<p>Give a smile, smile at the universe, someoneâ€™s always watching, so why not Smile. Greet the new day with your best Duchenne.</p>
