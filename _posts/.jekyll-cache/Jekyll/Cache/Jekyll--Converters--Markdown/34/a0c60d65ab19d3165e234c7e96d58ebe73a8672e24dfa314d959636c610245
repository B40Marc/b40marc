<p>Smiles are contagious, and multiply. There are at least 15 types of smiles. Babies are innate smilers, and a smile is  universally one of each humans first acts.</p>

<p>Smiles can be faked, even insincere. And then there’s the Duchenne smile, look it up. The real deal, it’s nearly unfakable and a genuine expression of inner emotion. Duchenne’s involve lips, cheeks and eye muscles which have no voluntary motor response.</p>

<p>Give a smile, smile at the universe, someone’s always watching, so why not Smile. Greet the new day with your best Duchenne.</p>
