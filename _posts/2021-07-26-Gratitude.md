## With a Grateful Heart  

Each day is a blessing full of opportunities to be grateful. Everyday I awake to the dawn with a new breath. Every meal. A daily shower. The clothes on my back. With so many blessings and gifts, how can one ever feel inadequate?  

To live my life with an attitude of gratitude.
