Mount Adams is the second highest of the 48 four thousand footers in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. This is the 31st mountain I've hiked of the forty-eight. Mount Adams is 4774 feet.  

Today was the second of a two day adventure, which included an overnight stay at the Madison Spring Hut and a climb to summit Mount Madison, yesterday. After a filling breakfast and plenty of coffee, my hike began at Madison Hut and the Gulfside Trail led up and around the Northwestern flank of Adams. At the Thunderstorm Jct, connecting to upper Lowe's trail for an easier ascent to summit.
