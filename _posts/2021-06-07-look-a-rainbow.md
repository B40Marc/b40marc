title: "Look a Rainbow!"

Who doesn't like a rainbow?  

Seeing a rainbow brings a universal spark of joy. It brings an instant smile, a surge of pleasure.  
 
Who can be ambivalent in one's presence? 
 
Rainbows are infrequent, but not rare.  
They are short lived, but not fleeting, often lasting for twenty plus minutes.  
 
Rainbows are actually full circles. They are optical illusions.  

If you see a double rainbow, in the outer one, the colors are reversed.  

Are you a rainbow lover too?  
Try not to google them, for example: 
 
"Some cultures in Burma, consider Rainbows as demons sent to threaten children!"  
  
Who knew?
