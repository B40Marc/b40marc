Why not smile? Smiles are contagious, and multiply. There are at least 15 types of smiles. Babies are innate smilers, and a smile is  universally one of each humans first acts.


Smiles can be faked, even insincere. And then there's the Duchenne smile, the real deal, nearly unfakable and genuine expression of inner emotion. Duchenne's involve lips, cheeks and eye muscles without voluntary motor response.

Give a smile, smile at the universe, someone's always watching, so why not Smile. Greet the new day with your best Duchenne.
