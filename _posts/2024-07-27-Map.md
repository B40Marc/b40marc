### Map Experiment with Leaflet

My effort to start publishing maps of my walks and hikes online.
Leaflet thru Github pages on Jekyll. 
Wish me luck.


{% leaflet_map {"zoom" : 13 } %}

    {% leaflet_marker {"latitude" : 44.010868,
                       "longitude" : -71.6491,
    "popupContent": "Russell Pond Campground"}
  %}

{% leaflet_geojson "/assets/geojson/2024-07-20T17-45-28Z2.geojson" %}

{% endleaflet_map %}

Yea!! Partial success, a map with a pop-up marker. The correct map, but not a walk trace. (resolved)  
I've been trying to add a "LineString" layer for days, literally, with no joy. So, I'll keep reading and experimenting. It will come.  

Double Yea!!. More success, and finally a trace of my walk/hike within the map. It's embarassing to think of how long this has taken and how many websearches I've made in the effort (hint:over a week).   

This walk was through Russel Pond Campground in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. I was surveying the entire campground for suitable campsites for future visits.

Also, I'd be remiss for not giving a thank you and shout-out to <a href= "https://davidjvitale.com">David Vitale </a> for his amazing work on the <a href= "https://davidjvitale.com/tech/jekyll-leaflet/"> jekyll-leaflet </a>plugin!
