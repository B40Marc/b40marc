<p>Who doesn’t like a rainbow?</p>

<p>Seeing a rainbow brings a universal spark of joy. It brings an instant smile, a surge of pleasure.</p>

<p>Who can be ambivalent in one’s presence?</p>

<p>Rainbows are infrequent, but not rare.<br />
They are short lived, but not fleeting, often lasting for twenty plus minutes.</p>

<p>Rainbows are actually full circles. They are optical illusions.</p>

<p>If you see a double rainbow, in the outer one, the colors are reversed.</p>

<p>Are you a rainbow lover too?<br />
Try not to google them, for example:</p>

<p>“Some cultures in Burma, consider Rainbows as demons sent to threaten children!”</p>

<p>Who knew?</p>
