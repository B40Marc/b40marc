Today was my standard street walk, about 3.4 miles just past the New Hampshire border line. It took 61 minutes. A good walk, earbuds jamming 90's grunge playlist. Nice evening with a slight breeze and cool in comparison to recent weather. Otherwise, unremarkable. This photo actually taken previously, but a curiosity. Fairly certain human intervention involved, as no trees in the area.
